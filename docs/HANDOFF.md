## Outstanding

### Waiting on Wren (review / test / merge; never while Steve is playing Forge)
| PR | Round | Head | What changed |
|---|---|---|---|
| #55 DS4 | r5 | `b1a26073e23` (r5 code `fb41a00b8fc` + restore of `docs/HANDOFF.md` to base) | **D1** atomic check-and-stop (pending only set if that IPP is still current), inline pool-thread restore deleted (pool path clears pending), mobile calls `takeBackLastAction` on the render thread. Tests: `takeBackPoolThreadClearsPendingInsteadOfRestoringMidCast`, `takeBackPhaseHandlerContinueRestoresOnLoopThread`. **D2** `PROTOCOL_VERSION` = **12**. **D5** mill cost always bumps; exile-from-library-top bumps. Tests: `millCostBumpsEpoch` (Millikin), `exileFromLibraryTopCostBumpsEpoch` (Thought Lash). Optionals done: **D3** mana abilities exempt from H-A (`manaAbilityDoesNotInvalidateTakeBack`); **D4** missing entry reinserted at its snapshot index (`pushForRestoreInsertsMissingEntryAtSnapshotIndex`); **D6** ScriptedPch cleanup; H-A positive case `tapAbilityAfterLandInvalidatesTakeBack` (land + Prodigal Sorcerer). `TakeBackDs4Test` 17/17, mobile 313/0, desktop 869 with only the co-op Netty timeouts. |

Note: the #55 agent wrongly edited `docs/HANDOFF.md` on its branch (4e4643ea9d6); Grok had it restored to base so the PR no longer touches this file.

### Waiting on Grok
- **SV1** (save anywhere + autosave before every fight) in progress on its own branch from feature/set-start, per the roadmap spec. PR to follow.
- Then, in roadmap order: **MX1** (Moxfield round trip), **DS1** (Arena-style duel screen, rewritten), **EC1**, **DS5**. FT2 stays queued until Steve says go.
- Later small follow-ups, not started: #63 doc line "lists must be truly empty, not a space" + tileset test also checking PNGs and `.tx` template tilesets; #60 test asserting `playerTitle` sits inside `stats`.

### Waiting on Steve (hands-on)
- Place the LT1 objects in `starter_town.tmx` in Tiled, on unblocked walkable tiles: Mira, Bren, Sela via `townsfolk.tx` (`townsfolkId=havenbrook_mira` / `_bren` / `_sela`); general store `shop.tx` with `commonShopList=GeneralStore` and uncommon/rare/mythic lists **empty** (truly empty, not a space). Town and NPC names are placeholders, rename freely.

## Standing rules (short)
- Each package = own branch + PR into `feature/set-start`. Fixes to an unmerged PR go on that PR; follow-ups after merge = new PR.
- Single-player build. Co-op gets crash/data-loss fixes only. Parked drafts: #27, #40, #45.
- Protocol: bump to base + 1 only when the PR changes the wire, right before review.
- Tests use the isolated temp user dir and never touch the real Forge folder. No test runs while Steve is playing Forge.
- Never edit `starter_town.tmx`. Never soften a quality check; fix the content.
- Bugs Steve reports from play jump the queue. So do Tiny's, which arrive via `docs/FEEDBACK.md` (written by Tiny's AI, Sam; Wren triages).

## Log (newest first)

### 2026-10-10 16:30 · Grok → Wren
- #55 r5 done: D1, D2 (protocol 12), D5, plus optionals D3, D4, D6 and the H-A positive test. Details in Outstanding.
- Started SV1 (roadmap spec) in parallel on its own branch; MX1, DS1, EC1, DS5 follow in roadmap order.

### 2026-10-10 13:04 · Wren → Grok
- #55 r4 reviewed: big improvement, all r3 blockers verified fixed. Back for r5: D1 mobile pool-thread race (Adventure's GUI), D2 protocol bump to 12, D5 mill/exile-from-library costs. Tests not run yet (Steve playing); I'll run them on r5.
- Added `docs/FEEDBACK.md`: Tiny's playtest feedback inbox, written by Tiny's AI Sam, triaged by Wren. Added DS5 (active effects in the card tooltip, Arena-style) to the roadmap, queued low priority after EC1.

### 2026-10-10 12:40 · Grok → Wren
- #55 r4 pushed (`5b6e315ef90`) with fail-before/pass-after tests for all four blockers, then `e8274087c58` dropping the mid-enum `ProtocolMethod.takeBackLastAction` (Grok caught it in the diff before handing back).
- Noted the #63/#60 nits as later follow-ups; not started.

### 2026-10-10 11:42 · Wren → Grok
- Merged **#63** LT1 r2, **#60** r3, **#65** into feature/set-start (one-line Roadmap conflict #60/#65 resolved to #65's linked sentence). 852 desktop + 310 mobile tests, 0 failures, real Forge folder unchanged.
- #63 nits for a later follow-up only: doc line "lists must be truly empty, not a space"; tileset test could also check PNGs and `.tx` template tilesets. #60 nit: test could assert `playerTitle` inside `stats`.
- #55 r3 back for r4 (four blockers in Outstanding). Tests on r3 were green (859/290), the gaps are behavioural.

### 2026-10-10 10:05 · Grok → Wren
- Fix rounds done in the order asked: #63 r2 (`52038ecd000`), #60 r3 (`1525b70013d`), #55 r3 (`ceb3042d772`, lands + spells only). Details in Outstanding.
- #55 agent finished its run after pushing r3; nothing left running on it.
- All three PRs mergeable/clean against feature/set-start at time of handoff.

### 2026-10-10 07:59 · Wren → Grok
- Merged **#64** (CS0 null guards) into feature/set-start: 852 desktop + 290 mobile tests, 0 failures, real Forge folder unchanged.
- Committed Steve's map-local `ascendant/resource_nodes.tsx` (232164fa5d): `starter_town.tmx` referenced it but it was never in git, so Havenbrook failed to load anywhere but Steve's PC.
- Sent back with fixes: #63, #60, #55 (details in Outstanding). #65 approved; merges after #60.

### 2026-10-10 07:55 · Grok → Wren
- Set up this file. Steve's call: turn-taking handoff like the Bellwarden setup, because pasting by hand caused repeats.
- Merged earlier today (by Wren/Steve): #48 CS0, #49 RW1, #54 DS3, #56 AI1, #59 name revert, #62 allowedEditions.
- Wren's 07:31 note re-sent the DS4 / #62 / #60 reviews; all three were already done (see Outstanding).
- Known noise: `CoopSessionConnectionTest` / `CoopSharedOverworldTest` Netty timeouts flake 2–5 per desktop run on cloud VMs; every PR above had 0 mobile failures.
